          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Sandify turns your cold, empty-hearted, emotionless sand tables into cold, empty-hearted, emotionless sand table robots with enchanting patterns.</p>
          <p>
            Sandify is a labor of love, but if you&apos;d like to support me financially,
            I do have a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jeffeb3">Donation system set up with github</a>. Or just <a href="https://www.paypal.me/jeffeb3">PayPal</a>.

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
            Part of the fun of Sandify is playing it like you would a xylophone.
            <br/>
            Try it out first. The goal is to make it easy to make your first pattern by just clicking and scrolling, finding something you like.
            <br/>

          <h2>Sand Machine</h2>
          <p>Anything that uses gcode can be used with Sandify. But the machine this was designed for is the ZenXY from V1Engineering.com.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://docs.v1engineering.com/zenxy/">ZenXY on V1Engineering.com</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            ZenXY was inspired by the awesome Sisyphus kinetic art table by <a href="https://sisyphus-industries.com/">Sisyphus Industries</a>, which is also now supported.
          </p>
